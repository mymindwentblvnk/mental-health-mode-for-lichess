* Deeplinks are still not cleaned. There are only the frontpage, the user's profile the active game sites and the analysis board cleaned. So there are some sites left to take care of.
* I am not sure if working with `display: none` (CSS) is best practice. May be switching to `.remove()` (Javascript).
* A version for Google Chrome is needed.
